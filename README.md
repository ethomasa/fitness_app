Completion of this app included the buidling out of the exercise model for the Mongo DB formatting to ensure the correct logging of the various fields in the application. As there are two different types of workouts avaialble, resistance and cardio, the requried fields for each of them will be the same while there are a few fields that are only specific to the type of workout being logged.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
